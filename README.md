# Frond-End Training

This repository contains a lot of codes about my studies of the **"Front-end Training"** by Alura platform: https://www.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end

Each folder refers to a course of the training. In general, the folder has a *base project* and its *final project*. Inside the final project, we will probably have some folder with codes from each course class individually.

The codes are in Portuguese PT-BR (variable and function names, etc) since the original training is in PT-BR. They are over-commented since I intend to use them as references guides when needed.

All projects were developed in WebStrom IDE.

// You are not loading an unique App anymore but a Routes component that will handle the routes and
// will trigger the mounting and rendering of the components which shall load within each route.
//
// As a matter of fact, <Router /> works as a Higher Order Component that only knows its children in the
// future and interacts with them in a more wide scope, independently of who and how many they are.
//
// Just make sure you understand that React.DOM is not anymore loading a simple App.
// Itâ€™s loading the App embraced by a Component called Router that in a higher instance or scope can interact
// with it and with the browser DOM.

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
